`1. What is Linux?`

Linus Torvalds developed Linux, a Unix-like, free, open-source, and kernel operating system. Mainly it is designed for systems, servers, embedded devices, mobile devices, and mainframes and is also supported on major computer platforms such as ARM, x86, and SPARC.

`2. Explain the basic features of the Linux OS?`

Some basic features of Linux are:
- Linux is free and easily available.
- It is more secure than other operating systems because it uses security auditing and password authentication features.
- Linux has its personal software repository.
- It includes multiple languages throughout the world. Hence Linux supports different language keyboards.
- It offers CLI and GUI to use different commands and applications such as Firefox, VLC, etc.

`3. Explain the boot process?`

The boot process is your computer's startup sequence. It loads the operating system and prepares everything for you to use the system.
- Power On & BIOS Check
- Hardware Test (POST)
- Find Bootable Device
- Load Kernel (OS Core)
- Startup System Services
- Login & User Interface

`4. What is Hardlink and Softlink?`

There are two types of link(ln) in linux

**Hark link:** 
- It is the mirror file of original file
- It is used for backup
- If you create link the inode address is for both the files is same becoz it takes the spaces for one file only we can't put the files in cross filesystems(one is /dev/sda1 and another one is /dev/sda2)

**Softlink:**
- It is used to create the shortcuts of a file
- If you create a link then the inode address is different in both the files
- If you delete the original file then you can't access the link(now it is useless) we can put the files in cross filesystems(one is /dev/sda1 and another is /dev/sda2)

`5. What is Inode`

It is given when we create a new file(this is unique for all the files)

`6. What are the default umask values?`

`10. What is df and du?`

**du** measures the disk space used by files and directories, while **df** reports on the total, used, and available space on a file system:

`11. Explain LILO?`
LILO, i.e., Linux Loader and is a Linux Boot loader. It loads the Linux operating system into memory and starts the execution. Most operating systems like Windows and macOS come with a bootloader. While in Linux, you need to install a separate boot loader, and LILO is one of the Linux boot loaders.
